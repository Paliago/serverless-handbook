# Test the setup

In this section you will test the entire setup and learn more about the flow.

## Send command

From the Slack channel that you have created run this command to start a translation: '/translate "Hello! How are you? This is an automatic translation." sv-SE, fr-FR'
This should, if everything is correctly setup, create a translation back to the channel and the audio for it.

Repeat for all of the StepFunctions to understand what they do, and what data was handled.

## Test additional command

What will happen if you send command '/translate "Hello! How are you?", sv-SE'?
Why do you think this happens?
