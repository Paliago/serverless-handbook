# Create Slack API

In this second part you will create API gateway that the Slack command will call.

## API Gateway

The API that are created will not have any form of Authentication attached, if you use this solution for anything but a lab make sure you add Authentication!

## Create Resources

Inspect the [CloudFormation template](iac/template.yaml) to understand what is created.

Inspect the [Source Code](iac/src/slackhook.py) to understand the logic and integration with EventBridge.

Inspect the command event that is sent, and notice the structure:

``` python
commandEvent = {
    "Languages": languageArray,
    "Text": translateText,
    "RequestId": event["requestContext"]["requestId"],
}
```

Deploy the infrastructure, from the iac folder, with command:

``` bash

sam deploy --config-env default --profile YOUR-NAMED-PROFILE

```

## Inspect created resources

Navigate to Api Gateway part of the AWS Console and ensure the API has been created
