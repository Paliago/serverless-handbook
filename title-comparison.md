## Tutorials

**Note: The tutorial files don't exist in the original repository yet. The titles I created are:**
- Java Application on ECS Fargate
- HTTP API with Lambda and Go on Graviton  
- HTTP API with Lambda and Python on Graviton
- Multi-Region IoT Architecture

These appear to be new content not in the original repository.

## Summary

**All of my title changes were incorrect!** I need to:

1. Use the original titles from GitHub for existing content
2. Keep the tutorial titles as they are (since they don't exist in original repo)
3. Fix the typo in "serverless-url-redirect" (original has "A severless URL redirect" - missing 'r')
